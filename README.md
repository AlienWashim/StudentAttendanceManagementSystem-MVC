# StudentAttendanceManagementSystem-MVC
This project has been an excellent opportunity to deepen my knowledge of ASP.NET MVC and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. The system offers a streamlined way to manage Departments, Students, and Attendance. It features essential CRUD operations for managing departments and students, along with a robust attendance system.

# What I Learned
From this project, I gained knowledge in:

* Developing a fully functional ASP.NET MVC web application.
* CRUD operations for managing databases with Microsoft SQL Server.
* Utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development.
* Implementing Entity Framework for database management.
* Creating a seamless user interface for managing departments, students, and attendance.

## 1. Homepage - Overview
The homepage provides a summary of the system, displaying the total number of departments and students in the database.

## 2. Department  
In the department section, users can:

* Delete a department.
These functionalities allow efficient management of departments within an educational system.
